# Neural-Network

To enhance my understanding of neural networks and their variants, I am constructing basic neural networks for this project without relying on external packages. I will continually update and list the lessons learned below.

## Model

1.  Neural Network
2.  Recurrent Neural Network
3.  Convolutional Neural Network
4.  Long Short-Term Memory
5.  Gated Recurrent Unit

## Activation function

1.  Tanh
2.  ReLU
3.  Leaky ReLU
4.  Parametric ReLU
5.  Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)
6.  Scaled Exponential Linear Unit (SELU)
7.  Softmax
8.  Sigmoid
